# jelbrekLibE
- jelbrekLib, but for (E)lysian Jailbreak

# NOTE :
- jelbrekLibE contains some modifications to support working with time_waste by Jake James and the Elysian Jailbreak by chr1s_0x1 & others (names private for now). jelbrekLibE might still (from current ver you're seeing) be modified more in the future.

- Not everything will be updated for iOS 13, only whats required for Elysian & time_waste to work with jelbrekLibE. Not fully sure if these modifications will work in future exploits, but you can try if you want.

- The dylib in the downloads folder will be updated after every commit with the text " [update] description here ". If you don't see the most recent commit with it, changes are probably still to come. 

## Download JelbrekLibE
jelbrekLibE can be downloaded in the downloads folder as a dylib and linked into Xcode. Check the ReadMe by Jake for more info.
